    "title": "What Is MetaBitcoin Network",
    "description": "The MetaBitcoin Network, centered on the BTC chain, can dynamically link other Bitcoin isomorphic chains, forming a scalable network. It fully solves Bitcoin's expansion issue and enables building a Bitcoin-based Web3 network for 80 billion people globally to use.",
    "features": {
      "0": "Entirely built on Bitcoin's tech and consensus, skipping the need for new inventions.",
      "1": "Able to hook up with mainstream UTXO chains, skipping hefty dev or new public chain launches.",
      "2": "It drives dynamic, limitless expansion, bearing the world's daily Web3 needs.",
      "3": "It can fully utilize the infrastructures of other side chains, such as layer-one smart contracts or layer-two EVMs."
